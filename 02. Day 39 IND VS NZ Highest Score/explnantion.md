The function <code>maximumScore</code> calculates the maximum score that can be obtained from a list of difficulty scores, given a certain number of tasks that can be skipped. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. If no tasks can be skipped <code>(k == 0)</code>, the function returns 0.

2. The function initializes a list <code>pow2</code> to store powers of 2, which will be used later to calculate scores.

3. It creates a 2D list <code>difficulty_dp</code> to store the maximum scores that can be obtained for different ranges of tasks.

4. The function then iterates over the tasks. For each task, it calculates the length of the range of tasks that cannot be skipped and the number of tasks that have been removed (skipped). It then calculates the maximum score for the range of tasks that cannot be skipped and stores it in <code>difficulty_dp</code>.

5. The function continues to iterate over the tasks, this time considering ranges of tasks that can be skipped. For each range, it calculates the maximum score that can be obtained by either skipping the current task or not skipping it. It updates <code>difficulty_dp</code> with the maximum score.

6. Finally, the function returns the maximum score for all tasks, modulo <code>10^9 + 7</code> to prevent overflow.

This function uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum score. The 2D list difficulty_dp is used to store intermediate results, which greatly speeds up the calculation. The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the number of tasks. Let me know if you have any questions!
