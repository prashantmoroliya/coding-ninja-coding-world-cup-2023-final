This C++ code is designed to solve a problem related to segment trees and array manipulation. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function <code>updateTree</code> is used to update a value in the segment tree. It takes as parameters the current node, the start and end indices of the current segment, the target index to update, the new value, and the segment tree itself. It updates the value at the target index and then updates the maximum value in the current segment.

2. The function <code>queryTree</code> is used to query the maximum value in a range in the segment tree. It takes as parameters the current node, the start and end indices of the current segment, the start and end indices of the query range, and the segment tree itself. It returns the maximum value in the query range.

3. The function <code>ninjaAndLessMaxElement</code> is the main function. It takes as parameters the size of the array and the array itself. It initializes the segment tree and a 2D vector positions to store the positions of each element in the array.

4. The function then iterates over the array and updates positions accordingly.

5. The function initializes a result vector and then iterates over positions. For each element, it queries the maximum value in the range between the current position and the previous position in the segment tree and stores it in the result vector. It then updates the segment tree with the current element.

6. Finally, the function returns the result vector.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the size of the array, as it performs a segment tree update and query for each element in the array. Let me know if you have any questions!
