This C++ code is designed to solve a problem related to graph theory and dynamic programming. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function <code>modInverse</code> calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number under a given modulus.

2. The function <code>dfsFirstTraversal</code> performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to determine the order of vertices for the second DFS traversal. It marks each visited vertex and adds it to the order vector.

3. The function <code>dfsSecondTraversal</code> performs the second DFS to find strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph. It also calculates the size of each SCC.

4. The function <code>dfsSuffixArray</code> calculates the suffix array for each vertex in the tree using dynamic programming. The suffix array stores the sum of the DP values for all vertices in the subtree rooted at the current vertex.

5. The main function <code>randomlySorted3</code> first calculates the powers of the inverse of k modulo 1e9 + 7. It then constructs the graph and its reverse graph from the given edges.

6. It performs the first DFS traversal to determine the order of vertices for the second DFS traversal.

7. It performs the second DFS traversal to find SCCs in the graph and calculates the product of the powers of the sizes of the SCCs.

8. It constructs a new tree where each vertex represents an SCC in the original graph.

9. It calculates the DP values and the suffix array for each vertex in the tree.

10. Finally, it returns the product of the cycle product and the suffix array of the representative of the first vertex in the order, modulo 1e9 + 7.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of vertices in the graph, as it performs a DFS on the graph. Let me know if you have any questions!
